# Scala Learning Notes

My notes and small experiments from my first contact with Scala, coming from the "Scala At Light Speed" course.

## About

This repository contains personal study materials documenting my learning process with Scala. Examples and notes were written as I watched the course videos, serving as reference material and practice.

## Origin

This repository was initially cloned from: https://github.com/rockthejvm/scala-at-light-speed

Starting from the base structure provided by the course, I added my own examples, experiments and notes to consolidate the learning.
## Purpose

To record my learning journey with Scala, from basic concepts to more advanced features, creating personal reference material for future consultation.
